# aws-three-tire-infrastructure
This project sets up a Three-Tier Architecture on AWS, including a web server, application server, and RDS database. The infrastructure is manually configured for scalability, security, and high availability. It covers networking, security groups, and other essential AWS services to ensure a fully functional deployment. ðŸš€
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Services that we are used :

1] Amazon EC2 Instances : These virtual servers host your web and application tiers.

2] Auto Scaling Groups (ASG): Automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic demands, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

3] Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming client traffic across your web tier EC2 instances, enhancing availability and fault tolerance.

4] Amazon S3: Stores static assets like images, videos, and other media files, enabling efficient content delivery.

5]Amazon EFS: Provides a scalable file storage solution accessible by multiple EC2 instances, facilitating shared access to data.

6] Amazon RDS (Aurora MySQL): Manages your relational database, offering high availability and scalability for data storage and retrieval.

7] Amazon VPC: Defines your virtual network environment, isolating resources and controlling network traffic.

8] Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors application performance and resource utilization, providing insights for optimization.

9] Amazon SNS: Facilitates communication between components, such as sending notifications or triggering workflows.

10] AWS CloudTrail: Records API calls and user activity, aiding in security analysis and compliance auditing.

11] Amazon Route 53: Manages DNS routing, directing user requests to the appropriate resources.
Amazon CloudFront: Delivers content with low latency by caching static assets at edge locations.

Architecture Overview :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fb3804-983f-4475-bc58-e7bb1a633c5f)

   ARCHITECTURE FLOWN :

Client Request: Users access your React.js website, which is served by Nginx web servers on EC2 instances.

Static Content Delivery: Static assets are retrieved from Amazon S3, ensuring fast and reliable access.

API Calls: API requests are forwarded by Nginx to the internal-facing Application Load Balancer.

Application Processing: The Application Load Balancer directs these requests to Node.js application instances.

Database Interaction: The application tier interacts with the Aurora MySQL database on Amazon RDS for data operations.

Response Delivery: Processed data is sent back through the application tier, load balancer, and web tier to the client.

SECURITY AND MONITORING

IAM: Manages access controls and permissions for AWS resources.

CloudWatch: Monitors application performance and resource utilization, providing insights for optimization.

CloudTrail: Records API calls and user activity, aiding in security analysis and compliance auditing.

HIGH AVAILABILITY AND SCALABILITY :

Auto Scaling Groups: Ensure that the number of EC2 instances adjusts automatically based on traffic demands.

Multi-AZ Deployment: Deploys RDS instances across multiple Availability Zones for fault tolerance.

CloudFront: Caches content at edge locations to reduce latency and improve user experience.

Creating 3 Tire Architecture & Integrating other AWS Resources

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1 : Download Code from my Github in your Local System

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2 : Create Two S3 Buckets
